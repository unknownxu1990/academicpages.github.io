I am a fourth year Ph.D candidate in Computer Science Department at Columbia University. My two advisors are Prof. Daniel Hsu (Computer Science Department) and Prof. Arian Maleki (Statistics Department). 

My research focuses on high dimensional statistics and machine learning algorithm. I am also interested in interactive learning/clustering and neural network.
